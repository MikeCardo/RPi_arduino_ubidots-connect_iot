## Conection between RPI <img src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/-Raspberry Pi-E30B5D?style=flat&logo=Raspberry Pi&logoColor=white">, Arduino <img src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/-Arduino-3186a0?style=flat&logo=Arduino&logoColor=white">   and Ubidots IoT Project
first steps, project to learn how connect devices to Internet trhough Ubidots.

### Preliminary info
<p align= left> It is my first project to share in <img src="http://img.shields.io/badge/-Github-000000?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=FFFFFF">, my first steps to charge repos and to be part of community ðŸ«‚ if you have recomendation for me I'm happy to hear you and correct my code <\> , please send my your comments to improve my knowledege </p>

### Connection between devices IoT / UBIDOTS
<p>3 segment of code are implemented,<br> First of them is implemented on RPi - what is the reponsible to comunication between Arduino and Ubidots, the code are implemented in python, <br> 
The second one is implemented in Arduino, the Arduino is the part that interacts with real world trhough actuators (relays) to control ligths in house and <br>
The last one is implemented in UBIDOTS platform for IoT trough MQTT protocol send/recieve the info with json.format</p>
